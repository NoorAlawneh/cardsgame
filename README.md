# 21cardsgame
The Twenty One Cards Game
This is a well known card trick game that is performed by beginner magicians. The game
uses a selection of 21 cards out of a standard deck. These are shuffled and the player
selects one at random. The cards are then dealt out face up in three columns of 7 cards
each. The player points to the column containing their card. The cards are picked up and
the process is repeated three times, at which point the magician reveals the selected card
==================================================================================================
• a Java application that simulates this game (no graphics is required)
• using stacks, queues, collections, etc.
• Design your application to be modular (use classes, interfaces, and packages)
• The game should be interactive, i.e. the application should ask the player for his/her
choice as if it is played with real cards, and the player should be able to enter the
choice for three times before the application reveals the final result
• There should be only one card deck in the game (singleton design pattern)
• The iterator design pattern should be used whenever it’s needed to iterate over
the elements of the underlying data structures
• Each game should be logged to a unique file; you may use the system time in order
to name the logging files. Information to be logged is: the original 21 cards, the
three 7 cards groups and the player choice (for three times), and finally the result
